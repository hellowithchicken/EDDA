# Exercise 1
Moldy bread If left alone bread will become moldy, rot or decay otherwise.  To investigate the influence of temperature and  humidity  on  this  process,  the  time  to  decay  was  measured  for  18  slices  of  white  bread,  which  were placed in 3 different environments and humidified or not.  The data are given in the filebread.txt, with the first column time to decay in hours, the second column the environment (cold, warm or intermediate temperature) and the third column the humidity.



```{r}
data <- read.table(file="data/bread.txt",header=TRUE)

```
